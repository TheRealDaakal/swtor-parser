from .bar_overlay import BarOverlay
"""
overlay.py

Chrome-less, background-transparent bar overlays that float directly on the
game -- the ORBS/BARAS style -- rather than a window sitting on top of it.

The trick is Windows-only: `-transparentcolor` tells the window manager to
punch out every pixel of one exact colour. Paint the window and canvas that
colour and only the marks you draw remain visible, so there is no panel, no
border and no background at all. Those punched-out regions are also
click-through, so the overlay doesn't eat mouse input meant for the game.

Two deliberate departures from the chart palette used elsewhere:

- Colours are more saturated. The chart palette is validated against a known
  fixed surface; an overlay sits on whatever the game is rendering, which
  might be a white flash or a dark corridor a second later. Legibility on an
  unknown, moving backdrop wins.
- Every string is drawn with a 1px black outline (the same text stamped at
  eight offsets underneath). Canvas text has no stroke option, and without
  it light text vanishes the moment something bright passes behind it.

Falls back to a plain dark panel if `-transparentcolor` isn't supported, so
this degrades instead of breaking off-Windows.
